What is git
-----------
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with multiple developers efficiently. 
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for managing the development of the Linux kernel.

Key Features of Git:
------------------
Distributed System – Every developer gets a full copy of the repository, allowing offline work.
Branching & Merging – Allows developers to create separate branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments and merge them when ready.
Speed & Efficiency – Designed for high performance with fast commits, branching, and merging.
Security – Uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-1) to ensure integrity and prevent data loss.
Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
Rollback & History Tracking – Keeps a history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.

Git vs GitHub: What’s the Difference?
Many people confuse Git and GitHub, but they are not the same! Here's a simple explanation:

🔹 Git → A tool for tracking changes in code on your computer. Think of it as a time machine that helps you go back to previous versions of your project.
🔹 GitHub → A website that stores your Git projects online. It makes it easy to share, collaborate, and manage your code with others.

below is list of some commands:
Git Config Command:
------------------
1. git --version 
2. git config --global user.name "Your Name"
3. git config --global user.email "YourEmail@gmail.com"
4. git config --global color.ui auto 
5. git config --global core.editor nano
6. git config --global alias.st status
7. git config --global --list

Initializing and Managing Repository 
-----------------------------------
1. git init: The git init command is used to create a new Git repository in a project. It sets up the necessary files and folders for Git to start tracking changes.
   command: git init 

2.  git clone: The git clone command is used to copy (download) a remote Git repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on an existing project.

    How to use git clone:
    a. find the repository URL(From Github, GitLab)
    b. open a terminal or command prompt 
    c. run the following command:
       command: git clone <repo url>

3. git remote -v: – View Remote Repositories
   The git remote -v command is used to list the remote repositories linked to your local Git project. This helps you see where your project is connected online (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
   How to Use git remote -v?
   1. Open a terminal or command prompt
   2. Go to your git project folder:
      command: cd path/project
   3. Run the command:
      command: git remote -v

  Example output:
    origin  https://github.com/user/project.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/user/project.git (push)

4.git remote add origin <repo_url> : Add a Remote Repository

The git remote add origin <repo_url> command is used to link your local Git repository to a remote repository (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This allows you to push your code online and collaborate with others.

 command: git remote add origin <repo_url>
 example: git remote add origin https://github.com/user/project.git
 note: verify the origin by git remote -v

5. git remote remove origin: Remove a Remote Repository
The git remote remove origin command is used to disconnect your local Git repository from a remote repository. This is helpful if you want to stop syncing with the current remote or switch to a different repository.

command: git remote remove origin
note:verify the origin by git remote -v 

6. git remote set-url origin <new_url> : Change the Remote URL
The git remote set-url origin <new_url> command is used to update the URL of an existing remote repository (usually the "origin" remote). This is helpful if the URL of the remote repository changes (for example, when you change the repository's location on GitHub or GitLab).

command: git remote set-url origin <new_url>
example: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/new-repo.git
note: verify the origin by git remote -v

Tracking & Staging Files
------------------------
1. git status - Check the status of the working directory
   The git status command is used to check the current state of your working directory and staging area. It helps you understand:
    ✅ Which files are tracked and untracked
    ✅ Which changes are staged for commit
    ✅ Which changes are not staged
    ✅ If your branch is up-to-date with the remote repository
    
     Summary of Git Status Messages
     ------------------------------

 ->    Status Message: Working tree clean
       Meaning: No changes to commit
       Solution: No action needed
 
 ->    Status Message: Untracked files
       Meaning: New files not tracked by git 
       Solution: Use git add <file> to track them
 
 ->    Status Message: Changes not staged for commit
       Meaning: Modified files, but not added to staging
       Solution: Use git add <file> to stage them
 
 ->    Status Message: Changes to be committed  
       Meaning: Files are staged and ready to commit
       Solution: Use git commit -m "message" to commit
 
 ->    Status Message: Your branch is ahead of 'origin'
       Meaning: Local commits are not pushed to remote
       Solution: git push origin <branch>
 
 ->    Status Message: Deleted files not staged
       Meaning: Files were deleted but not committed
       Solution: Use git rm <file> to confirm deletion  	
        
2. git add - Stage a specific files for commit
   The git add command is used to stage changes in Git. Before committing changes, you must add them to the staging area using git add.
   
   Why Use git add?
   ✅ It prepares files for committing.
   ✅ It allows selective commits (you don’t have to commit all changes).
   ✅ It tracks new, modified, and deleted files. 
   
   1. git add <file> - Stage a specific file for commit
      command : git add filename.txt
      command: git add file1.txt file2.txt - add multiple file

   2. git add . - Stage all the changes in the directory
      This stages all modified and new files in the directory.
      Warning: This also stages unintentional changes. Use git status before running this command.
 
   3. git add -A - Stage all files (tracked + untracked)
      This is similar to git add ., but also tracks deleted files.
   
   4. git add -u - This stages only modified & deleted files, ignoring new files.
 
  How to verify Added Files:
  command: git status
  
  🔹 Before git add:
   Changes not staged for commit:
   modified:  index.html
   new file:  style.css
 
  🔹 After git add . :
   Changes to be committed:
   modified:  index.html
   new file:  style.css


🔹 Unstage a File (Undo git add)

 If you accidentally added a file and want to remove it from staging:
 
  git restore --staged filename.txt

 or for all staged files:
  git restore --staged .

 This removes files from the staging area without deleting the changes.
   
3. git reset <file> - Unstage a file (move it back to working directory)
   The git reset <file> command is used to unstage a file that was added using git add. It removes the file from the staging area, but keeps your changes in the working directory.

🔹 Why Use git reset <file>?

✅ Undo git add without losing file changes.
✅ Fix mistakes if you staged the wrong file.
✅ Keep your work but remove it from the next commit.

🔹 Basic Usage
git reset <file>
This unstages the specific file but keeps your changes.

🔹 Example Scenarios

1️⃣  Unstage a Specific File

git add report.txt
git reset report.txt

🔹 Before git reset (git status output)

Changes to be committed:
  new file: report.txt

🔹 After git reset report.txt (git status output)

Changes not staged for commit:
  new file: report.txt

2️⃣ Unstage All Files

git reset - This unstages all staged files.

git reset <file>:	Unstages the file but keeps changes.
git restore --staged <file>:	Does the same as git reset <file>.
git reset --hard:	Removes all unstaged changes.
git restore <file>:	Discards unstaged changes.

🔹 When to Use git reset <file>?

✔️ If you staged a file by mistake.
✔️ If you want to modify the file before committing.
✔️ If you need to review changes before committing. 


Commit Changes
------ ------

1. git commit -m "Message" - Commit staged changes with a message
   The git commit -m "Message" command is used to save staged changes in Git. It creates a commit, which acts like a snapshot of your project at that point in time.

🔹 Why Use git commit?

✅ Saves changes in Git history.
✅ Helps track modifications over time.
✅ Enables collaboration with other developers.
✅ Creates a checkpoint to revert back if needed.

🔹 Basic Usage
command: git commit -m "Added a new feature"

✅ This creates a commit with the message "Added a new feature".

 How git commit Works

1️⃣  Modified Files (Not Staged)
If you modify a file (index.html), running git status shows:
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified: index.html

You must stage the file before committing:
  command: git add index.html

2️⃣  Commit Staged Changes
command: git commit -m "Updated index.html"

Now git status will show:
nothing to commit, working tree clean

✅ Your changes are now saved in Git history.

3️⃣  Commit All Staged Files
   command: git add .
   command: git commit -m "Updated multiple files"
✅ This commits all staged changes.


🔹 Writing Good Commit Messages

A good commit message should:
✔️ Be short and clear
✔️ Explain what changed
✔️ Use present tense (e.g., "Fix bug", not "Fixed bug")

Examples of Good Commit Messages
✅ "Fix login bug in authentication system"
✅ "Add dark mode toggle feature"
✅ "Update README with setup instructions"


2. git commit --amend -m "New Message" - Modify the last commit message:

The git commit --amend -m "New Message" command allows you to change the last commit message without creating a new commit. This is useful if you made a typo or want to provide a better description.

🔹 Why Use git commit --amend?

✅ Fix mistakes in the last commit message.
✅ Add missing changes without creating a new commit.
✅ Keep the commit history clean.

🔹 Adding New Changes to the Last Commit
   If you forgot to add a file before committing:

      command: git add missing_file.txt
      command: git commit --amend -m "Updated commit with missing file"
✅ This updates the commit to include the new file.

🔹 Important Notes

🚨 Do NOT amend a commit that has been pushed to a shared repository!
If the commit is already pushed, amending it creates a new commit hash, which can cause conflicts for others.

🔹 How to Fix an Amended Commit After Pushing?

If you already pushed the commit and amended it, you'll need to force-push:
 git push origin main --force

🚨 Warning: --force can overwrite others' work, so use it carefully.

3. git commit --amend --no-edit - Modify the last commit without changing the message
   The git commit --amend --no-edit command allows you to update the last commit without changing its message. This is useful when you need to add new changes to the last commit without modifying the commit message.

🔹 Why Use git commit --amend --no-edit?

✅ Add missing files to the last commit.
✅ Avoid creating unnecessary commits.
✅ Keep the commit history clean.

🔹 Example Use Cases

1️⃣  Add a Missing File to the Last Commit
If you forgot to include index.html in your last commit:

command: git add index.html
command: git commit --amend --no-edit


✅ This updates the last commit without changing the message.

2️⃣  Modify a File Without Creating a New Commit
If you made a small change to style.css and want to update the last commit:
git add style.css
git commit --amend --no-edit

✅ Now the last commit includes the style.css changes without creating a new commit 

🔹 Important Notes

🚨 Avoid using --amend on pushed commits unless you're sure.
If you've already pushed the commit, you'll need to force-push:

command: git push origin main --force
⚠️ Warning: --force can overwrite others' changes, so use it carefully.


🔹 3. Git Branching and Switching

1. git branch - List branches
 The git branch command is used to create, list, rename, and delete branches in Git. Branches allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

  🔹 Basic Usage
   1️⃣  List All Branches
     commaand:  git branch
  ✅ Shows all local branches.
The current branch is marked with an asterisk (*).

🔹 Example output:
* main
  feature-login
  bugfix-header

To list remote branches, use:
command: git branch -r

To list both local and remote branches, use:
command: git branch -a

2. git branch <branch-name> - Create a new branch

The git branch <branch-name> command is used to create a new branch in Git. This allows you to work on a new feature or fix without affecting the main codebase.

🔹 How to Use git branch <branch-name>

1️⃣  Create a New Branch
 
 git branch feature-login

✅ This creates a new branch called feature-login, but does NOT switch to it.

3. git checkout <branch-name> - Switch to another branch

The git checkout <branch-name> command allows you to switch to an existing branch in Git. It moves your working directory to that branch, so you can work on different features without affecting the main branch.

🔹 How to Use git checkout <branch-name>

1️⃣  Switch to an Existing Branch
git checkout feature-login

✅ This moves you to the feature-login branch.

To verify your current branch, run:
command: git branch

The active branch is marked with an asterisk (*):
  main
* feature-login
  bugfix-header


4. git checkout -b <branch-name> - Create and switch to a new branch
The git checkout -b <branch-name> command creates a new branch and switches to it immediately. This is useful when starting a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main branch.

🔹 How to Use git checkout -b <branch-name>
1️⃣  Create and Switch to a New Branch
git checkout -b feature-login

✅ This does two things in one step:

Creates a new branch named feature-login.
Switches to feature-login.
To verify the switch, run:

command: git branch

  main
* feature-login  ✅ (Current branch)
  bugfix-header

5. git merge <branch-name> - Merge a branch into the current branch

The git merge <branch-name> command is used to combine changes from one branch into another. This is useful when you finish working on a feature branch and want to merge it back into the main branch.

🔹 How to Use git merge <branch-name>

1️⃣  Merge a Branch into the Current Branch
git checkout main     # Switch to the branch you want to merge into
git merge feature-login  # Merge 'feature-login' into 'main'

✅ This merges the feature-login branch into main.

To check if the merge was successful, run:

git log --oneline --graph --all

6. git branch -d <branch-name> - Delete a branch

git branch -d <branch-name>

is used to delete a local branch in Git.

Conditions for Deletion:
The branch must be fully merged into the current branch or its upstream branch.
If the branch has unmerged changes, Git will prevent deletion and show an error.

Force Delete (If Unmerged Changes Exist):
If you want to force delete a branch that has unmerged changes, use:
command: git branch -D <branch-name>
example: git branch -d feature-xyz

7. git branch -D <branch-name> - Force delete a branch
   The git branch -D <branch-name> command forcefully deletes a branch locally. This is useful when you no longer need a branch and want to remove it from your repository.

   command: git branch -D feature-branch

🔹 This deletes the branch named feature-branch.

🚀 When to Use?

After merging a branch (cleanup).
Discarding unwanted work (if changes are not needed).
Fixing mistakes (if a branch was created by accident).

⚠️ Important Notes

This only deletes the branch locally (not on GitHub or remote).
If the branch has unmerged changes, they will be lost permanently.


❌ Safer Alternative (-d instead of -D)
If you want to delete only if the branch is already merged, use:

commnad: git branch -d feature-branch

🔹 If the branch is not merged, Git will warn you instead of deleting it.

🗑️ Deleting a Remote Branch
If you want to delete a branch from the remote repository (e.g., GitHub), use:
command: git push origin --delete feature-branch

🔹 This removes the branch from GitHub/GitLab.

🔄 Example Workflow

1️⃣  Create and switch to a new branch:
 command: git checkout -b feature-test

2️⃣  Work on the branch and commit changes.
3️⃣  Merge it into main when done:

command: git checkout main
commnad: git merge feature-test

4️⃣  Now, delete the old branch:
command: git branch -D feature-test
✅ Branch is now deleted! 🚀

🔄 How to Restore a Deleted Git Branch?
If you accidentally deleted a branch using git branch -D <branch-name>, you can recover it as long as the commits were not permanently erased.


🛠 Method 1: Find and Restore Using git reflog (Best Method)

Even if a branch is deleted, Git keeps a log of all actions (called reflog).

🔹 Step 1: Find the Deleted Branch’s Last Commit

Run this command: git reflog

🔍 This shows a list of recent Git actions. Look for something like:
example: abc1234 HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from feature-branch to main

🔹 Step 2: Restore the Branch
Once you find the commit hash (abc1234 in this case), recreate the branch:
command: git checkout -b feature-branch abc1234
✅ Your deleted branch is now restored!


Difference Between git log and git reflog:
Purpose:
 git log: Shows the commit history of a branch
 git reflog: Shows the history of all HEAD movements (including resets, checkouts, and reverts)

Scope:
 git log: Displays commits in the repository
 git reflog: Displays both commits and branch movements

Visibility:
 git log: Only reflects reachable commits in the branch
 git reflog: Includes even deleted or lost commits (until garbage collection)

Usage:
 git log: Used to view commit history and authorship
 git reflog: Used to recover lost commits or track changes to HEAD

Example:
  git log:git log --oneline --graph
  git reflog: git reflog

      ------------------------------
🔹 6. | Viewing & Searching History |
      ------------------------------
  1. git log - Show commit history

   The git log command shows the history of commits in a repository. It helps you track changes, see who made them, and view commit messages.

🛠 Basic Usage:

To see the commit history, run:
command: git log

This will display:
Commit hash (unique ID)
Author (who made the commit)
Date (when it was made)
Commit message

Example output:

commit a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0
Author: Yogesh Jaiman <yogesh@example.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 11 10:30:00 2025 +0530

    Fixed login issue

🔎 Useful Options for git log

1️⃣  Show One-Line Summaries
command:  git log --oneline

✅ Displays a short version with just commit hashes and messages:
a1b2c3d Fix login issue
b3d4e5f Add new dashboard
c6f7g8h Initial commit


2️⃣  Limit the Number of Commits
command: git log -3
✅ Shows only the last 3 commits.


3️⃣  Show Changes in Each Commit
command : git log -p
✅ Displays the actual code changes for each commit.


4️⃣  Filter by Author

command: git log --author="Yogesh"

5️⃣  Show Commits in a Graph
command: git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate
